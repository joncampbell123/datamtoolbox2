Datamtoolbox v2

A cleaner rewrite of the data miner's toolbox. My programming skills have improved a LOT since 2005.

This is designed to work as a series of libraries that you can use independently (as much as possible)
from one another. You do not need to compile ALL the code into your projects to use these libraries.

This code is intended to be usable on Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows. At some point I would also like
to see this code work with DOSLIB to bring these utility functions to Windows 3.1 and MS-DOS.

Makefiles at first will be Linux only, but will eventually support Mac OS X and Windows as well as
through DOSLIB.
