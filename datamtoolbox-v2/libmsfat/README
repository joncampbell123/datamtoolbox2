Utility library to read and manipulate the FAT filesystem (MS-DOS).

TESTING NOTES:

1. When creating LFN test cases on Linux, make sure you use the 'vfat' driver,
   and you mount it with the utf8=1 option. If you do not set utf8=1, the vfat
   driver blindly copies the filename byte-for-byte to the LFN entry, which is
   NOT VALID UTF-16.

   mount -o loop,utf8=1 diskimage.img /mnt/diskimage
