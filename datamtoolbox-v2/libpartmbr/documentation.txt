MS-DOS master boot record partition table parsing/support code.

Normally used with 512 bytes per sector.
Originally used with C/H/S geometry, but the table does have LBA sector numbers too.

Sector 0:
  +----- partition 1 (absolute offset + size)
  +----- partition 2 (absolute offset + size)
  +----- partition 3 (absolute offset + size)
  +----- partition 4 (absolute offset + size)

If "extended partitions" are involved:

Sector 0:
  +----- partition 1 (absolute offset + size)
  +----- partition 2 (absolute offset + size)
  +----- partition 3 (absolute offset + size) extended partition type with singly-linked list of extended MBR records
     +---- extended MBR entry (absolute offset relative to extended partition base), and absolute offset relative pointing to next extended MBR entry
                      |
                      |
                     \|/
     +---- extended MBR entry (absolute offset relative to extended partition base), and absolute offset relative pointing to next extended MBR entry
                      |
                      |
                     \|/
     +---- extended MBR entry (absolute offset relative to extended partition base), and absolute offset relative pointing to next extended MBR entry
                      |
                      |
                     \|/
     +---- extended MBR entry (absolute offset relative to extended partition base), and absolute offset relative pointing to next extended MBR entry
                      |
                      |
                     \|/
     +---- extended MBR entry (absolute offset relative to extended partition base), and absolute offset relative pointing to next extended MBR entry
                      |
                      |
                     \|/
     +---- extended MBR entry (absolute offset relative to extended partition base), second entry is zero
  +----- partition 4 (absolute offset + size)
